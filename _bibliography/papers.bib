abstract = {Existing search heuristics used to find input values that result in significant floating-point (FP) errors or small ranges that cover them are accompanied by severe constraints, complicating their implementation and restricting their general applicability. This paper introduces an error analysis tool called Eiffel to infer error-inducing input ranges instead of searching them. Given an FP expression with its domain D, Eiffel first constructs an error data set by sampling values across a smaller domain ℛ and assembles these data into clusters. If more than two clusters are formed, Eiffel derives polynomial curves that best fit the bound coordinates of the error-inducing ranges in ℛ, extrapolating them to infer all target ranges of D and reporting the maximal error. Otherwise, Eiffel simply returns the largest error across ℛ. Experimental results show that Eiffel exhibits a broader applicability than Atomu and S3FP by successfully detecting the errors of all 70 considered benchmarks while the two baselines only report errors for part of them. By taking as input the inferred ranges of Eiffel, Herbie obtains an average accuracy improvement of 3.35 bits and up to 53.3 bits.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
