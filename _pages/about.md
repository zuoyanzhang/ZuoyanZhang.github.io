I am currently a first-year PhD student at the CYCLE Lab at Hunan University under the supervisor Prof. Jie Zhao. I got my MEng degree from the State Key Laboratory of Mathematical Engineering and Advanced Computing at Information Engineering University under the supervisor Prof. Shaozhong Guo in June 2024. My research interests span machine learning system and program analysis, with a particular focus on floating-point program error detection and automatic repair, as well as distributed parallel acceleration for large language model training. My research has been recognized with ASE, ISSTA.
